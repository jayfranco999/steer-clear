# STEER CLEAR - Drinking Rules

## The Official "I Can't Believe I'm This Bad At Fake Driving" Rulebook

---

### CRASH COURSE (literally)

| Your Failure | Your Punishment |
|--------------|-----------------|
| Crash into anything | 1 sip (your Uber rating just dropped) |
| Crash 3 times (you're out) | BOTTOMS UP your glass (insurance won't cover this) |
| Most crashes at end of game | BOTTOMS UP (you're the designated disaster) |

---

### GLORY MOVES

| Achievement | Your Reward |
|-------------|-------------|
| Chain of 10 | Pick someone to drink (you're basically a F1 driver now) |
| Chain of 25 | Pick 2 people to drink (Vin Diesel who?) |
| Survive longest | Watch everyone else suffer |

### UNWRITTEN LAWS

**The "I Wasn't Ready" Excuse**
- Doesn't matter. Drink.

**The "Camera Is Broken" Defense**
- We can literally see you flailing. Drink.

**The "This Game Is Rigged" Claim**
- The game heard you. Expect worse obstacles. Also drink.

**The "I'm Actually Sober" Statement**
- Bold claim for someone who just crashed 3 times in 20 seconds.

---

### OPTIONAL CHAOS (for the truly unhinged)

Enable these at your own risk:

1. **Backseat Driver** - Spectators yell "advice". If their advice causes a crash, THEY drink.

2. **Eyes on the Road** - Player must maintain eye contact with the TV. Looking at your hands = 1 sip.

3. **Phone a Friend** - On your 2nd crash, nominate someone to take the wheel for 10 seconds. If THEY crash, you both drink.

4. **Insurance Fraud** - Crash on purpose? Everyone saw that. Double punishment + skip next turn.

### END OF NIGHT

**Worst Driver Award:**
- Most total crashes = They're buying the next round

**Best Chain Award:**
- Crown them "Designated Driver" (ironically, they're probably plastered)

---

### REMEMBER

- Don't actually drink and drive. This is for virtual road rage only.
- Max punishment is ONE glass bottoms up. We're trying to have fun, not hospitalize anyone.
- If someone says "I'm good at racing games", they will crash immediately. It's science.
